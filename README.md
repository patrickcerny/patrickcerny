# Hey, Im Patrick!
I'm a 19 year old graduate from the HAK Bregenz and a full stack feveloper at [GMG AG](https://www.gmg.biz/start/default.aspx).

## What have I done so far?
So far, I've tried a lot of different stuff / technologies - but the one I kinda got stuck to is Web-Development, expecially with libraries/frameworks like React or Angular or even Blazor. If you want to look at the stuff I'm doing in my free time, just check my repos! Also, I'm the COP of [Otiosum](https://otiosum-austria.com), which makes me an official *EnTrePrenEur*!

## My Skills:
### Frontend
I love coding in the Frontend - especially with languages like **Typescript**, **Javascript** and **C#**. Mainly I use **React.js** and **Angular** or **Balzor** for my webapplications.

### Backend
Altough my first love was the Frontend, I still have a little crush on developing stuff in the backend - For my BE-Development I mainly use **Node.js with Express.js**, **C#** and sometimes even a little bit of **Python**. For databases - I'm a big fan of **document-based databases** and if sh\*t gets serious, I'm using **SQL / a relational database**.

### Other stuff I tried
I've made e. g. [a python bot](https://github.com/patrickcerny/typewriterBot),a ["private Instagram clone in React"](https://github.com/patrickcerny/friendstagram2.0) and lots of other stuff (most of them are sadly not open source, damn you companies!).

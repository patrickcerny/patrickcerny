# Hey, Im Patrick!
Im a 18 year old student at the HAK Bregenz and a Full Stack Developer.

## What have I done so far?
So far, I've tried a lot of different stuff / technologies - but the one I kinda got stuck to is Web-Development, expecially with libraries/frameworks like React or Angular. If you want to look at the stuff I'm doing in my free time, just check my repos!

## My Skills:
### Frontend
I love coding in the Frontend - especially with languages like **Typescript** and **Javascript**. Mainly I use **React.js** and **Angular** for my webapplications.

### Backend
Altough my first love was the Frontend, I still have a little crush on developing stuff in the backend - For my BE-Development I mainly use **Node.js with Express.js**, **C#** and sometimes even a little bit of **Python**. For databases - I'm a big fan of **MongoDB** and if sh\*t gets serious, I'm using **SQL**.

### Other stuff I tried
I've made e. g. [a python bot](https://github.com/patrickcerny/typewriterBot),a ["private Instagram clone in React"](https://github.com/patrickcerny/friendstagram2.0) and lots of other stuff.
